##### What did I do this past week?
I finished the Collatz project, I am fairly confident that setting up the environment, and making sure everything was correct to submit
took at least twenty times the amount of effort than solving the 3n + 1 problem. I do believe however that that is what the point of the
first project is, to learn how the workflow of the tools given to us, and to learn how to correctly set up your files to submit to Canvas.
In class we learned about pointers and references, which after taking CS439, I thought I have a good understanding of it. Well it turns
out I need a huge refresher on it so I'll be making come c++ files to mess around with pointers. 

##### What is in your way?
I made a mistake and cloned the whole class folder, breaking the testing script that the grades had. I read the piazza posts about 
having the correct files, but I thought it only pertained to the collatz project folder inside of the class folder, so I will stress
about that until my project gets graded, seeing whether I get penalized or not. Career fair is also coming around the corner, so I
need to update my resume, website, and find out more about interviewing skills. This is my last year and sadly enough, I have not had
an internship before, so my actual confidence in getting a job is not very high since Professor Downing emphasizes how good an internship
is in receiving a job after graduation.

##### What will you do next week?
I will look into the class project and find a partner to get started on it early. I will also try to do the readings since my quizzes
are not looking the best right now. I also need to prepare for the career festival and try not to stress out too much.

##### Tip-of-the-Week
I think a good general tip on when you come across a problem that you can't seem to solve, is first post on Piazza, and do something
that is not project related for twenty or so minutes. I had a lot of dumb small mistakes in my code or with Travis, that I would 
agonize and try to solve, but after twenty minutes of waiting on Piazza, I would find someone who helped me solve my dumb mistake
(so thank you OOp students!).
